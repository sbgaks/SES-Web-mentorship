# FIRST DAY OF SES WEB DEVELOPMENT TRAINING
Finally it has started, my journey towards becoming a full stack web developer. I had earlier began web development but did not have the guidance or motivation to move forward. Using the only device I had, **my phone** I began teaching myself but lacked the right _guidance_ . It was challenging and I lost morale and this went on for a while. Luckily out of all the struggle to learn I mastered the ***basics***. 

With SES,I believe I have a chance at rekindling the motivation and grow as a **WEB DEVELOPER**. I also want to channel my art into web development by creating web applications that are **AESTHETIC** :laughing:.

Through this ***3-month journey*** I'll be putting on record every step of it here on my Github account to track _my progress_. I am looking forward to gain the following skills:

1. HTML
   - Basic syntax
     - Forms and validation
2. CSS
   - Styling
     - Website Layout
       - Responsiveness
3. JavaScript
   - Functions
     - Objects
4. React

I am also using complementary learning sources such as [W3 SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

The qoute that motivates me most is:
